This project includes an analysis of several advertizing campaign results of big consumer brands on amazon.com, with a goal to look for potential ways of optimization to improve ROIs.

Technology I used:
- Prophet time series to forecast potential sales with budget increase and SHAPE values to identify factors affecting campaignâ€™s results.
- Random Forest Regressor from Sklearn to predict factors affecting sales 
- SHapley Additive exPlanations (Shap Values) algorithms for the model interpretation. 




## Project goals:

1. Analyze existing data to find best practices of advertising (slice by company / portfolio / ASIN).
2. Look into ways to optimize campaign with a focus on ROI increase by adjusting:
Keywords
Bid management
Time of day / week
Placements
Campaign type
3. Forecast potential sales with a budget increase.

## Results:

Found ways to increase ROIs by 4x times via campaign and targeting settings modifications
