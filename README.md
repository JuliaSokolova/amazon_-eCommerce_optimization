This project includes an analysis of several advertizing campaign results of big consumer brands on amazon.com, with a goal to look for potential ways of optimization to improve ROIs.

Technology I used:
- Prophet time series to forecast potential sales with budget increase and SHAPE values to identify factors affecting campaignâ€™s results.
- Random Forest Regressor from Sklearn to predict factors affecting sales 
- SHapley Additive exPlanations (Shap Values) algorithms for the model interpretation. 




## Project goals:

1. Analyze existing data to find best practices of advertising (slice by company / portfolio / ASIN).
2. Look into ways to optimize campaign with a focus on ROI increase by adjusting:
- Keywords
- Bid management
- Time of day / week
- Placements
- Campaign type
3. Forecast potential sales with a budget increase.

## Data

<p align="center"><img width=80% src=https://github.com/JuliaSokolova/amazon_-eCommerce_optimization/blob/master/img/schema.png> 

- MySQL DB in AWS
- 13 tables
- 104 campaigns
- Aug 2019 - Feb 2020


## Campaings EDA

To find best practices, I first calculated the average results of all campaigns:

Impressions: 10M
Clicks: 23K
Spend: $32K
Sales: $92K
ROI: 2.875

### Campaign types

<p align="center"><img width=70% src=https://github.com/JuliaSokolova/amazon_-eCommerce_optimization/blob/master/img/campaign_types.png> 

Amazon has 3 types of campaigns: Sponsored brands (SB), Sponsored product (SP), and Sponsored display (SD). 
Keeping in mind that average ROI for all campaigns is 2.875, I looked into ROI by campaign types.
Sponsored brands capmaigns have ROI 7.056!
First recommendation: invest in sponsored brand campaigns.

### Targeting

<p align="center"><img width=70% src=https://github.com/JuliaSokolova/amazon_-eCommerce_optimization/blob/master/img/targeting.png> 

When using automated targeting, ROIs go down. 
Second recommendation: use manual targeting.

### Ads placement

For ads placement, there are also things that can be improved.
Furthermore, ROIs are vary for different ad types.


<p align="center"><img width=70% src=https://github.com/JuliaSokolova/amazon_-eCommerce_optimization/blob/master/img/brand_ads.jpg>
  
For brand ads, top search works much worse than other placement: 7.07 vs 12.32 ROIs.
  
<p align="center"><img width=70% src=https://github.com/JuliaSokolova/amazon_-eCommerce_optimization/blob/master/img/product_ads.jpg>
  
For product ads, top search on first page of results perform the best: 4.317 vs 2.083 on the rest of the search.
The ads on product pages and off-amazon remarketing work terrible: 1.094 and 0.791.

## Search EDA

Let's take a look into keywords analysiz. 
My goal was to analyze into each keyword performance in dynamic. 
For this part, I used plotly library.

### Keyword performance

The charts below shows the performance for search term 'hand sanitizer' across all campaigns.

### Future prognosis 

To extrapolate future sales, I used Prophet time series. 
Below is a graph that predicts sales coming from keyword 'hand soap' for two upcoming months.

<p align="center"><img width=70% src=https://github.com/JuliaSokolova/amazon_-eCommerce_optimization/blob/master/img/search-sales-prognosis.png>
  
We can also see this search term sales overall trend, and weekly fluctuation component.

### Campaign analysis

Each Amazon ad campaign can have its own unique settings, therefore it might be a good idea to study search term performance for each campaign separatly. 





## Results:

Found ways to increase ROIs by 4x times via campaign and targeting settings modifications
